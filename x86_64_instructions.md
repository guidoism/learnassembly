5.6 SSE2INSTRUCTIONS
SSE2 extensions represent an extension of the SIMD execution model introduced with MMX technology and the SSE extensions. SSE2 instructions operate on packed double-precision floating-point operands and on packed byte, word, doubleword, and quadword operands located in the XMM registers. For more detail on these instruc- tions, see Chapter 11, “Programming with Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (Intel® SSE2).”
SSE2 instructions can only be executed on Intel 64 and IA-32 processors that support the SSE2 extensions. Support for these instructions can be detected with the CPUID instruction. See the description of the CPUID instruction in Chapter 3, “Instruction Set Reference, A-L,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A.
These instructions are divided into four subgroups (note that the first subgroup is further divided into subordinate subgroups):
• Packed and scalar double-precision floating-point instructions.
• Packed single-precision floating-point conversion instructions.
• 128-bit SIMD integer instructions.
• Cacheability-control and instruction ordering instructions.
The following sections give an overview of each subgroup.

INSTRUCTION SET SUMMARY
5.22 VIRTUAL-MACHINEEXTENSIONS
The behavior of the VMCS-maintenance instructions is summarized below:
VMPTRLD VMPTRST VMCLEAR
Takes a single 64-bit source operand in memory. It makes the referenced VMCS active and current.
Takes a single 64-bit destination operand that is in memory. Current-VMCS pointer is stored into the destination operand.
Takes a single 64-bit operand in memory. The instruction sets the launch state of the VMCS referenced by the operand to “clear”, renders that VMCS inactive, and ensures that data for the VMCS have been written to the VMCS-data area in the referenced VMCS region.
Reads a component from the VMCS (the encoding of that field is given in a register operand) and stores it into a destination operand.
Writes a component to the VMCS (the encoding of that field is given in a register operand) from a source operand.
VMREAD
VMWRITE
The behavior of the VMX management instructions is summarized below:
VMLAUNCH
VMRESUME
VMXOFF VMXON
Launches a virtual machine managed by the VMCS. A VM entry occurs, transferring control to the VM.
Resumes a virtual machine managed by the VMCS. A VM entry occurs, transferring control to the VM.
Causes the processor to leave VMX operation.
Takes a single 64-bit source operand in memory. It causes a logical processor to enter VMX root operation and to use the memory referenced by the operand to support VMX opera- tion.
The behavior of the VMX-specific TLB-management instructions is summarized below:
INVEPT Invalidate cached Extended Page Table (EPT) mappings in the processor to synchronize address translation in virtual machines with memory-resident EPT pages.
INVVPID Invalidate cached mappings of address translation based on the Virtual Processor ID (VPID).
None of the instructions above can be executed in compatibility mode; they generate invalid-opcode exceptions if executed in compatibility mode.
