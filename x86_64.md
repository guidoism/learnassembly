## TODO:
* Read about [Trusted Execution (TXT)](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-developers/intel-txt-software-development-guide.html)
* Find the "data sheet" for the cpus I care about

## Testbeds

* Emulator, which one?
* My Sandy Bridge computer to test with real hardware, maybe get small monitor?
* [Up Core](http://www.up-board.org/upcore/) - [Intel x5-z8350 CPU](http://ark.intel.com/products/93361/Intel-Atom-x5-Z8350-Processor-2M-Cache-up-to-1_92-GHz) - 64 bit
* Intel Edison - 32 bit - [How To Guide](http://www.helios.de/heliosapp/edison/)

## Notes

* Addresses are in bytes, little endian, and may include segments of the form ```DS:FF79H``` where the
  segment is loaded into the register ```DS``` and the address is ```FF79H```.
