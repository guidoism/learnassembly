# Guido Learns Assembly

I haven't written assembly since college and even then I didn't really
get too far into it. I want to learn the low-level details of a couple
different cpus architectures and I figure this is the best way.

## Targets

* Intel Joule module: x86_64 T5700 CPU, 4GB RAM, 16GB flash, Intel HD GPU, 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1, USB 3.0, MPI* CSI and DSI interfaces, and multiple GPIO, I2C, UART interfaces
* Kaby Lake Y-series CPU
* 64 bit ARM
* One of the power sipping ARM processors

## Resources

* [shellbug](https://github.com/karttoon/shellbug) - Text-based virtual CPU using [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org) CPU emulator framework
